This plugin is supposed to be used from GVIM. It sends code to a repl running 
inside a screen session running in a terminal application.

Use the |:Rescreen| command to initialize a screen session. If no repl is 
defined for the current filetype, bash is used.

Default maps (see |g:rescreen#maps|):

    <c-cr> ... Send the current line or the visual selection to the current 
               screen session
    gx.    ... Send the current line to the current screen session
    gx{motion} ... Send {motion} lines to the current screen session


Background:
Why another screen-based plugin? The code for this plugin was originally 
created for my rcom_vim plugin to fit its requirements. Since it has proven 
useful, I put the code into a plugin of its own.

This plugin is also meant to be the foundation for filetype/repl-specific 
plugins like the rer vim plugin (https://github.com/tomtom/rer_vim/).
