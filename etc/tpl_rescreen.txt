*rescreen.txt*  Yet another plugin that uses screen to evaluate code
                Author: Thomas Link, micathom AT gmail com?subject=vim

This plugin is supposed to be used from GVIM. It sends code to a repl running 
inside a screen session.

Default maps (see |g:rescreen#maps|):

    <c-cr> ... Send the current line or the visual selection to the current 
               screen session
    <localleader>e{motion} ... Send {motion} lines to the current screen 
               session
